                    <h2>History and specification of COBOL</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Background:</b> In the late 1950s, computer users and manufacturers grew concerned about rising programming costs. Mary K. Hawes organized a meeting at the University of Pennsylvania to discuss common business languages. The Department of Defense sponsored the effort, recognizing the benefits of portable programs.</li>
                        <li><b>COBOL-1960:</b> In 1959, a Pentagon meeting aimed to create a common programming language for business. The goal was to enable more people to program and not be limited by technology limitations. The Committee on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL) was formed, consisting of a steering committee, short, intermediate, and long-range committees. The committee examined FLOW-MATIC, AIMACO, and COMTRAN programming languages, with FLOW-MATIC being particularly influential. IBM's COMTRAN language was considered a competitor, but some features were not incorporated into COBOL.</li>
                        <li><b>COBOL-1961 to COBOL-1965:</b> COBOL 60, a language with numerous logical flaws, was deemed unambiguous by General Electric's Charles Katz. A short-term committee cleaned it, and by 1963, it was reported that its syntax was as definable as ALGOL's. COBOL is difficult to write a compiler for due to its large syntax, optional elements, and complexity. Compilation speeds increased from 3-11 statements per minute to 11-1000 statements per minute. IBM announced COBOL as their primary development language in 1962.</li>
                        <li><b>COBOL-1968:</b> In 1962, ISO and ANSI formed groups to standardize COBOL, with ANSI producing USA Standard COBOL X3.23 in 1968, which became the foundation for later versions.</li>
                        <li><b>COBOL-1974:</b> By 1970, COBOL became the world's most widely used programming language. The CODASYL Programming Language Committee improved the language through new versions in 1968, 1969, 1970, and 1973. In 1974, ANSI published a revised version with new features.</li>
                        <li><b>COBOL-1985:</b> In 1978, COBOL-74 was revised to COBOL-80, causing concerns about incompatibility and conversion costs. The Data Processing Management Association opposed the new standard, citing prohibitive conversion costs. ISO installed the international COBOL Experts Group in 1979 to address public concerns. In 1985, the ISO Working Group 4 accepted the revised standard, making several changes and adding new features. The new standard was adopted by all national standard bodies, including ANSI.</li>
                        <li><b>COBOL-2002:</b> In 1997, Gartner Group estimated 200 billion COBOL lines, accounting for 80% of business programs. In the 1990s, work began on adding object-orientation, incorporating features from C++ and Smalltalk. The final ISO standard was approved in 2002, introducing new features like free-form code, user-defined functions, and improved interoperability.</li>
                        <li><b>COBOL-2014:</b> Between 2003 and 2009, three technical reports on COBOL were produced. COBOL 2002 faced poor support due to lack of user demand and slow standardization.</li>
                        <li><b>COBOL-2023:</b> The COBOL 2023 standard introduced new features such as asynchronous messaging, transaction processing, XOR logical operator, CONTINUE, DELETE FILE, line sequential file organization, infinite looping, and base-conversion functions.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <q><i>The academic world tends to regard COBOL as verbose, clumsy and inelegant, and tries to ignore it, although there are probably more COBOL programs and programmers in the world than there are for FORTRAN, ALGOL and PL/I combined. For the most part, only schools with an immediate vocational objective provide instruction in COBOL.</i></q><br/>
